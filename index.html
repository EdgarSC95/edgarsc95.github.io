        <h2>Problem statement: Students Finding Parking</h2>

        Students have trouble finding unoccupied and don't know where to park at certain times of the day without getting intro trouble. An app to help display the best times to park and which parking spots are most convenient would be extremely helpful to those that have difficulties.
